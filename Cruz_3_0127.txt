To add an image to our slick games we put the download of the picture in our files,
and either adjusted it in gimp or put it directly in our res folder. 
It makes it possible for NetBeans to access the picture. 
The code would be (with just an example from my game) Image healingpotion = new Image("res/health_potion.png");
This image is drawn on the game so that when I give it it's code to give health, I can pick it up on my map.
