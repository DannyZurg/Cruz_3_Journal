One thing that I learned while using the aurdino was how to add new notes so that the piezo played those notes.
We had to add a new number of beats and the song length had to be lengthend. The rests counted as well.
Another thing that I learned was how precise the wires and resistors had to be placed. If a wire wasn't in the same row as 
whatever object, it wouldn't work. When we added a light in an area that we didn't use before, we had to make sure the wire went 
to the light the same way as the rest.
Finally, the other thing I learned was how careful you have to be with the code. One small typo could ruin the whole thing.
In the end we were able to get help and figure it out.
