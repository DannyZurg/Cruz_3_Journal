WHAT DIFFERENCES AND SIMILARITES HAVE YOU NOTICED? PROVIDE AT LEAST 3 AND EXPLAIN IN COMPLETE SENTENCES.
To what?
WHAT CODE ADAPTATIONS HAVE YOU MADE? [OR WILL YOU MAKE IF NONE TO DATE. NOTE: 'NONE' IS NOT A VALID ANSWER]
We have not made any adaptaions because we didn't see anything that was wrong. We will have to put two sets of code together later
though.

WHAT IS REQUIRED FOR A CIRCUIT?
A source of energy.
A conductive path which would allow for the movement of charges.
And an electrical resistor which is loosely defined as any object that uses electricity to do work.

HOW ARE PROGRAMS COMPILED WITH ARDUINO?
First, the Arduino environment performs some small transformations to make sure that the code is correct C or C++. 
It then gets passed to a compiler, which turns the human readable code into machine readable instructions. 
Then, your code gets combined with the standard Arduino libraries that provide basic functions like digitalWrite() or Serial.print(). 
The result is a single Intel hex file, which contains the specific bytes that need to be written to the program memory of the chip 
on the Arduino board. This file is then uploaded to the board: transmitted over the USB or serial connection via the bootloader 
already on the chip or with external programming hardware.
