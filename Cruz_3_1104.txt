A method is a small program that we use to catorgorize what we're doing in the program.
It lets us know where we've gone wrong. The methods I used were static void playthegame
and static void guess3Times. I used them to tell the player how many guesses they had
left and the directions of what to do. Also to tell them if they guessed too high or too
low. A while loop is a funtion that we put in our code to repeat the action in the code 
until the boolean is true. I used my while loop to continue showing that they guessed
wrong. I used a boolean to have a number that was true so that if the player guessed 
correctly boolean is true. The counter I used made it so that once the player either used all thier guesses or guessed right, it would let them try agoin in the end.
