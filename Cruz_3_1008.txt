Some plans I have for my art projectis to use different methods to make a bunch of
geometric shapes that form a picture.

Some method that I might use are ones that cna create shapes of different colors and 
sizes.

Some math that i might use is how much each side of the shapes are and adding them 
together to make different lengths for my art project.
