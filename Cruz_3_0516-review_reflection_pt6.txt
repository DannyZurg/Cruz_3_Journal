Explain casting. Up-casting, Down-casting.
Upcasting:Becoming very generalized, less specific
Downcasting:Becoming very detailed and specific

Give a specific code example for up-casting
 Cat c1 = new Cat();		 
    Animal a = c1;		 //upcasting to Animal
    if(a instanceof Cat){ // testing if the Animal is a Cat
        System.out.println("It's a Cat! Now i can safely downcast it to a Cat, without a fear of failure.");        
        Cat c2 = (Cat)a;
    }
Give a specific code example for down-casting
class Animal {
	int health = 100;
}
class Mammal extends Animal { }
class Cat extends Mammal { }
class Dog extends Mammal { }
public class Test {	 
	 public static void main(String[] args) {
		 Cat c = new Cat();
		 System.out.println(c.health);
		 Dog d = new Dog();
		 System.out.println(d.health);
	 }  
}
Give a specific code example for converting a char to a String

What is the range of values for byte? Why?

I got the answers of up and down casting from
