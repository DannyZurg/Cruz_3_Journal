Explain this code:
public Animation Playeranime, up, down, left, right, sprite, wait;
    public Player() throws SlickException {
        SpriteSheet runningSS = new SpriteSheet(
                "res/ogrespritesheet.png", 64, 64, 0);
        up = new Animation();
        up.setAutoUpdate(true);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(0, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(1, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(2, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(3, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(4, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(5, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(6, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(7, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(8, 8), 330);
        It loads the spritesheet.

Why would it be unrealistic / unproductive to memorize Slick syntax - what are the skills we were trying to practice?
It would be unrealistic to memorize Slick syntax

What is an array?
An array is data structure (type of memory layout) that stores a collection of individual values that are of the same data type.

How do you make an array? Give an example.
One way to create the array would be to use the code int[] anArray;. 
Another way to create an array would be tovuse this code:
anArray = new int[10];.
e.g. int[]anArray{
100,200,300,
400,500,600,
700,800,900,1000
};

What is an ArrayList?
 a resizable array that can hold different objects.
to specify the datatype of an arraylist use <>,e.g.
Arraylist <int> myNumbers = new Arraylist();

How do you make an arraylist?
Arraylist<String>whatever = new Arraylist();
whatever.add(“Stuff”);

In Netbeans, make an arraylist. Use autocompletion with the created arraylist (the '.' and pop-up):

What are three useful arraylist methods that you identified?
public Player player; , public Enemy Aldo, and public item healthpotion

What is the difference between an array and an arraylist?
An array cannot be resized,i.e. it is static, while an arraylist can be,i.e. it is dynamic. 

How could we make a health counter for an avatar?
public void takeDamage(){
health -= damage;
}
