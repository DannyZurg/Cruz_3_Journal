Write a Java method to return the cubed value of some number.
Write an Arduino function to return the cubed value of some number.
Create the class, an object, and class constructor for class student
Describe - if we were to continue with Arduino - what would you create?

import java.util.Scanner;
public class Student{
public static void main(String [] args){
Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.print("Please enter a number to square and cube: ");
    int n = in.nextInt();
    cubedNumber(n);
}
public static int squaredNumber(int n){//Question 4
    System.out.println("You entered " + n);
    n = n * n;
    System.out.println("Squared = " + n);
    return n;
}
public static int cubedNumber(int n){
    squaredNumber(n);
