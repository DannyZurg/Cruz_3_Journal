Which type is Java? How do you know, i.e., what characteristics does it have of that language type?
Java is a high level because high-level languages have few, if any, language elements that translate directly into a 
machine's native opcodes    
    
Which type is Assembly? How do you know, i.e., what characteristics does it have of that language type?
Assembly is a low-level because Machine code is the only language it can process directly without a previous
transformation.
