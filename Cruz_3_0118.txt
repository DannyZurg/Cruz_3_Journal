I left the game the same where you collect health and speed potions to find an antidote
but the potions and antidotes are a person...AND HIS NAME IS JOHN CENA!!! I changed
my sprite so that he had gold armor and a spear. I finished making my map but I didn't
start making my spritesheet. I didn't have enough time because of how hard it was to keep
some parts of the map straight. I havent been able to meet the timeline so far because
my map wont go into the game and my enemy wont appear.
