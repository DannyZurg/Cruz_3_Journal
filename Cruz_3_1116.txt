I will use methods to make different choices in the game. For example, in order to 
move on you have to choose a direction. The different directions have a different method that gives you another choice.
So if you go right or left, you'll have a different challenge, but a method must be setup 
to show which way you have decided to go.

I do not know what the values are that I am supposed to pass to my methodss.
