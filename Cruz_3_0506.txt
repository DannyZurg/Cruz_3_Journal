Given mymap[67][43] Which is the x coordinate? Which is the y coordinate? Why? How does this happen?
Consider:
        for (int i = 0; i <= map[0].length - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= map[1].length - 1; j++) {
                if (j < map[1].length - 1) {
                  if (i=0){ System.out.print("8888"); #a
                    } else if (map[i][j] != 'x') {
                        System.out.print("."); #e
                    } else {
                        System.out.print(map[i][j]); #b
                    }
                } else {
                    if (map[i][j] != 'x') {
                        System.out.println("."); #c
                    } else {
                        System.out.println(map[i][j]); #d
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
        
        
      
The y coordinate is 67 and the x coordinate is 43. This happens because java is a "row major", which means rows first.
