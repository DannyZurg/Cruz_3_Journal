The Slick assignment was intended to gently familiarize you with 2-D arrays. Some students recognized the 2-D arrays from 
Slick and previous journals --- other students had no recollection. Which were you? Why? Note - attributing the environment 
is not pragmatic - as students experienced the same environment (though they might have experienced it differently)Make a 
list of ten questions related to the Array assignments pt 1 and 2 - that you predict will be on the semester exam.
E.g., object initialization, class constructors, creating and changing arrays, etc.

I remembered a quite a bit from the other things we did with arrays. I remembered how we used arraylists to keep all the 
things that were the same(enemies,traps,and healthpotions) together.

1.How would you create a class object?
2.How would you end a while loop?
3.How did the player lose in your array game?
4.How did your player get killed by enemies?
5.How did your player move in different directions?
6.What data type did you use to make your array?
7.How did you make the difficulty increase?
8.How did the traps not appear but still harm the player?
9.How did you make your walls?
10.How did you upgrade your player?
